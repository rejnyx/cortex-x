# Migrations

> Per-version migration notes. Empty until first breaking change.
>
> When a tag introduces a breaking change (config schema, hook contract, prompt path, standard that existing projects depended on), add a section here keyed by the target version. `cortex doctor --migrate` (when implemented) reads this file to guide users.

## Format

```markdown
## vX.Y.Z (YYYY-MM-DD)

### Breaking
- [WHAT changed] — [WHY]
- **Migrate:** [concrete steps]
- **Rollback:** [if applicable]

### Deprecated
- [WHAT is scheduled for removal] — [target version]
```

## Current

_No migrations. First entry will land with v0.1.0 or the first breaking-change tag, whichever comes first._
