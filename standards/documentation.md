# Standard - Documentation (living docs + cortex-doc-regen)

> Documentation that rots is worse than no documentation. cortex-x splits docs into two layers: **hand-curated wisdom** (principles, decisions, rationale) and **auto-regenerated state** (counts, paths, LOC, test stats). The state layer is owned by `bin/cortex-doc-regen.cjs` via managed-block markers. The wisdom layer is owned by you.

This standard codifies the contract. It supersedes the legacy "Documentation - Knowledge That Outlives Your Memory" guidance for cortex-x repo docs; project-level docs (README, CLAUDE.md, PROGRESS.md, ADRs) keep their original conventions and add managed blocks opt-in.

## When to use auto-regeneration

**Decision tree — what goes where:**

| Content type | Layer | Owner | Example |
|---|---|---|---|
| Counts (capabilities, tests, action_kinds) | auto | `cortex-doc-regen` | "18 action_kinds in registry" |
| File paths + LOC tables | auto | `cortex-doc-regen` | "bin/steward/execute.cjs - 412 LOC" |
| Test/coverage stats | auto | `cortex-doc-regen` | "2955 tests passing, 0 failing" |
| CI lane status | auto | `cortex-doc-regen` | "test.yml: green, install-smoke.yml: green" |
| Recent commit list (last N) | auto | `cortex-doc-regen` | "Last 10 commits: ..." |
| File-size tables / module inventory | auto | `cortex-doc-regen` | "Top 20 largest files by LOC" |
| Dependency snapshot | auto | `cortex-doc-regen` | "deps: zod@4.x, handlebars@5.x" |
| Principles / philosophy | hand | operator | "SSOT means one authoritative source" |
| Architectural decisions + rationale | hand | operator | "Why we chose Phoenix over Langfuse" |
| Mental models | hand | operator | "cortex holds wisdom, CLAUDE.md holds state" |
| When-to-use guidance | hand | operator | "Use ai-agent profile when AI IS the product" |
| Identity / voice / positioning | hand | operator | "agentic-ready by default" |
| Categorization with curated labels | semi-auto | operator approves | "this capability is observability vs safety" |

**Rule of thumb:** if the value can rot in a week (because code changed), it's auto. If it stays valid for months/years (because intent is stable), it's hand. Semi-auto = the regen tool proposes a categorization, operator commits or edits before the block is finalized.

**When NOT to auto-regenerate:**

- Inside ADRs (decisions are immutable once accepted)
- Inside `standards/` principle docs (rules don't have counts)
- Inside `LESSONS-LEARNED.md` / journal entries (those are append-only)
- Inside `README.md` first 20 lines (front-door messaging stays hand-curated)

## State block convention

All managed regions in cortex-x markdown files MUST use this exact markup contract. Deviation breaks `cortex-doc-regen.cjs`.

**Canonical form:**

```
<!-- BEGIN cortex-x <block-id> (v<N>) - managed by <tool-name> -->
<!-- Do not edit between markers - regenerate via: <command> -->
<rendered content>
<!-- END cortex-x <block-id> -->
```

**Block-id naming (non-negotiable):**

- kebab-case, ASCII only
- no double-dash `--` (breaks HTML comment parsing)
- reserved IDs Sprint 2.45: `state-snapshot`, `capability-counts`, `test-counts`, `coverage`, `loc-summary`, `git-activity`, `deps`
- snake_case forms also reserved for renderer-internal lookup: `state:snapshot`, `state:counts`, `state:loc` (these are tool-internal keys, NOT used in marker IDs)

**Version suffix:**

- `(v1)` MANDATORY in BEGIN marker
- bump on schema break (e.g., column rename in a table)
- regen detects stale versions via regex `BEGIN cortex-x ([a-z-]+) \(v(\d+)\)`

**Tool suffix:**

- `managed by cortex-doc-regen` for state blocks
- enables `grep -r "managed by"` audit across the repo
- other CLIs that ship later (e.g., `cortex-capabilities`) use their own tool name

**Indentation rules:**

- markers MUST live at column 0
- markers MUST NOT be nested inside lists, tables, blockquotes, code fences (CommonMark parsers break on nested HTML comments)
- content between markers preserves its own indentation
- markdown headings, lists, tables permitted inside markers
- no trailing whitespace on any marker line

**Whitespace contract:**

- exactly one blank line before BEGIN
- exactly one blank line after END
- inside markers: leading + trailing single newline
- content lines as needed between

**Allowed content types inside markers:**

- markdown tables (most common — counts, file lists, test summaries)
- markdown lists (capability rosters, recent commits)
- prose paragraphs with auto-generated values
- code fences with language tag for diagrams (mermaid acceptable)

**Forbidden content types inside markers:**

- nested `<!-- BEGIN cortex-x ... -->` markers
- hand-edits that the next regen run will overwrite
- prose that contradicts the rendered facts (e.g., "we have 5 action_kinds" outside the marker while marker shows 18)
- HTML other than the marker comments themselves

**Replacement semantics:**

- regen replaces ONLY content strictly between matched BEGIN/END pair
- content above BEGIN and below END is preserved byte-for-byte
- orphan BEGIN without END = skip + log warning, never auto-repair
- mismatched block-id (BEGIN says `state-snapshot`, END says `capability-counts`) = skip + log
- duplicate BEGIN with same ID = use first, log warning

**Load-bearing match regex:**

```
/<!-- BEGIN cortex-x ([a-z][a-z0-9-]*) \(v(\d+)\) - managed by ([a-z-]+) -->\n([\s\S]*?)\n<!-- END cortex-x \1 -->/g
```

Backreference `\1` enforces matched IDs. Any state-block tooling MUST use this exact regex shape.

**Reference SSOT:** This standard (`standards/documentation.md`) is the single source of truth for the marker contract. Sprint 2.45.1 may extract to `standards/state-blocks.md` if a second consumer beyond `cortex-doc-regen` emerges (currently only `cortex-claude-md-augment` uses a similar but distinct marker pattern).

## Hand-prose currency convention {#hand-prose-currency}

> Sprint 2.46.2 extension. State blocks (above) close the auto-regen layer — code-derived counts converge on every regen. The hand-prose around state blocks is the remaining drift surface: a paragraph that says "cortex-x ships 30 standards" rots the moment standard #31 lands. This section codifies the hand-prose contract and the `cortex-doc-currency` lint that enforces it.

The lint detects two failure classes: (1) **numeric-claim drift** — prose asserts a count that disagrees with the nearest state block or with `cortex-doc-regen --json` snapshot; (2) **frontmatter expiry** — a doc declares `last_human_review:` or `expires:` and the reference date has passed.

### Decision tree

When you need to mention a count, ask three questions in order:

1. **Is the value derived from code/tests/repo state and likely to change within a sprint?** → use a state-block reference (pattern A). The block carries the live value; prose around it reads the block via `{{state.<key>}}` placeholder or "see state-block above".
2. **Is the value a rough magnitude that the reader needs for context, not a precise figure?** → use a qualified narrative (pattern B). Phrases like "dozens of standards", "over 30 action_kinds", "around 3000 tests" pass the lint because the qualifier carries explicit tolerance.
3. **Is the value a frozen historical fact (decision-time snapshot, ADR rationale, post-mortem footprint)?** → use the point-in-time frontmatter (pattern C). The doc declares `point_in_time: true` and the body is immutable; the lint stays silent.

Avoid the fourth path — a bare literal count outside a state block, without a qualifier, without a point-in-time declaration. That is the F1 forbidden pattern below.

### Approved patterns

**A — State-block reference (live counts):**

```markdown
<!-- BEGIN cortex-x state-snapshot (v1) - managed by cortex-doc-regen -->
| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Standards | 34 |
| Action kinds | 18 |
<!-- END cortex-x state-snapshot -->

cortex-x ships across Rule 0-3 — see the snapshot table above for the live count.
The standards directory is the SSOT for principle documents.
```

*Why this passes:* the count lives inside the marker (regen owns it); the prose names the table, not the number. Refactors that add a standard update the table on the next regen and the prose stays correct.

**B — Qualified narrative:**

```markdown
The standards directory holds dozens of files spanning Rule 0-3.
Each file carries a single principle plus its enforcement contract.
```

*Why this passes:* "dozens" is a qualifier the lint recognizes (alongside "approximately", "around", "roughly", "about", "over", "more than", "nearly", "~", trailing `+`). The reader gets context without a specific number to rot. Use this when the exact count is not load-bearing for the paragraph's argument.

**C — ADR point-in-time frontmatter:**

```markdown
---
adr_id: 047
date: 2026-05-08
point_in_time: true
as_of_snapshot:
  standards_count: 30
  action_kinds: 14
---

# ADR-047 — Phoenix replaces Langfuse for OTLP traces

At decision time, cortex-x had 30 standards and 14 action_kinds. The Phoenix flip
was scoped against that footprint and remains valid for the operating envelope it
described.
```

*Why this passes:* `point_in_time: true` opts the file out of claim lint and expiry checks. The body is treated as an immutable historical record. Use for ADRs, sprint memos, audit snapshots, retrospectives, dated research notes.

### Forbidden patterns

**F1 — Bare literal count in prose without state-block backing:**

```markdown
# Bad
cortex-x ships 30 standards across Rule 0-3.

# Fix — pattern A (live)
cortex-x ships {{state.standards_count}} standards (see snapshot above).

# Fix — pattern B (qualified)
cortex-x ships dozens of standards across Rule 0-3.
```

*Why forbidden:* the literal `30` rots silently when standard #31 lands. Pattern A pulls the count from regen; pattern B drops the precision in exchange for stability.

**F2 — Mixed literal and state-block reference in same paragraph:**

```markdown
# Bad — two SSOTs for the same fact
<!-- BEGIN cortex-x state-snapshot (v1) - managed by cortex-doc-regen -->
| Standards | 34 |
<!-- END cortex-x state-snapshot -->

cortex-x has 30 standards. The breakdown is shown above.

# Fix — drop the literal, reference the block
cortex-x ships standards across Rule 0-3 — see the snapshot above.
```

*Why forbidden:* two declarations of the same count guarantee one will go stale. SSOT discipline: name the value in exactly one place.

**F3 — Feature-bullet literal without state-block citation:**

```markdown
# Bad
- 2447 tests passing across 8 tier gates

# Fix
- Test suite spans 8 tier gates (see state-snapshot for current count)
```

*Why forbidden:* feature bullets in `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, atlas docs are read top-of-funnel; a stale number in a feature bullet damages credibility more than a stale number in a deep prose section. Same fix as F1 — name the dimension, not the value.

### Frontmatter fields

Opt a doc into freshness tracking by adding YAML frontmatter at file top:

```yaml
---
last_human_review: 2026-06-03    # ISO-8601 date; computed expiry = this + cadence_days
expires: 2026-09-03              # ISO-8601 date; explicit expiry, overrides computed
point_in_time: true              # immutable historical doc — no expiry, no claim lint
cadence_days: 90                 # override the path-default cadence
doc_currency_disable: true       # silence claim lint, keep expiry tracking
doc_currency_waive_until: 2026-09-01  # blanket waiver until this ISO date
---
```

Field semantics:

- `last_human_review` — most recent date the operator read the file end-to-end and confirmed it reflects current intent. The lint computes `expiry = last_human_review + cadence_days` and warns once the reference date passes.
- `expires` — explicit expiry date. Wins over the computed `last_human_review + cadence_days` when both are present. Use for time-bounded docs (e.g. quarterly roadmap, dated announcement).
- `point_in_time: true` — declares the file an immutable historical record. No expiry warnings, no claim lint. ADRs, sprint memos, audit snapshots, research notes.
- `cadence_days` — overrides the path-default cadence below. Use sparingly — prefer adjusting the path-default if the override would apply to a whole class of files.
- `doc_currency_disable: true` — silences claim lint on the file while keeping expiry tracking. Use when claim lint produces sustained false positives despite qualifiers.
- `doc_currency_waive_until: <ISO date>` — blanket waiver (claims + expiry) until the date. Useful during a deprecation runway where the file is intentionally stale until removal.

Files without any of these fields are silent — claim lint runs, expiry tracking is opt-in.

### Default cadence per doc type

| Path glob | Cadence | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| `runbooks/**` | 30 days | Operational procedures rot fast — env changes, tool versions, infra updates |
| `cortex/atlas-*.md`, `cortex/capability-tree-*.md` | 30 days | Snapshot artifacts; explicit dated filename signals freshness expectation |
| `prompts/**` | 60 days | Prompt drift follows model releases; revisit each major release |
| `standards/**` | 90 days | Principles change slower than code; quarterly review fits sprint cadence |
| `README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md` | 180 days | Front-door docs; semi-annual review |
| `docs/research/**`, `**/adr-*.md`, `cortex/journal/**` | point-in-time (implicit) | Historical artifacts; never expire |
| else | 180 days | Conservative default — adjust per-file via frontmatter or per-glob in config |

Grace period: each cadence carries a 14-day soft window. Within the window the lint emits a yellow warning (severity 1). Past the window it emits red (severity 2). Both stay warn-only unless `--strict` is passed.

Tune cadences and globs via `cortex/config/doc-currency.json`:

```json
{
  "cadenceByPath": { "runbooks/": 30, "standards/": 90, "prompts/": 60 },
  "graceDays": 14,
  "pointInTime": ["docs/research/**", "**/adr-*.md"]
}
```

### Lint integration

The lint ships as `bin/cortex-doc-currency.cjs` — zero-dep CJS CLI with the same shape as `cortex-doc-regen` (`--check`, `--json`, `--apply`, `--help`):

```bash
node bin/cortex-doc-currency.cjs --check       # exit 1 on stale claim or expired doc
node bin/cortex-doc-currency.cjs --json        # ESLint-shaped findings to stdout
node bin/cortex-doc-currency.cjs --apply       # autofix unambiguous numeric drift
node bin/cortex-doc-currency.cjs --strict      # red findings exit 1 (else warn-only)
```

The CLI is deterministic — it reads the reference instant from `$CORTEX_LINT_NOW` (ISO-8601) or `--now <iso>`, never from `Date.now()`. CI sets `CORTEX_LINT_NOW=$(git log -1 --format=%cI HEAD)` for reproducible runs.

**Composition with `cortex-doc-regen`:** doc-currency calls `cortex-doc-regen --json` once per run to fetch the live state snapshot, then walks the doc set and compares each prose claim against the corresponding snapshot key (`nounToStateKey` map in config). The two CLIs share zero code; the JSON contract is the only interface.

**Composition with the sprint pipeline:** see [standards/sprint-pipeline.md](./sprint-pipeline.md) — Step 7 of the canonical sprint pipeline runs `cortex-doc-regen --apply` to refresh state blocks; doc-currency is the verification layer that catches the hand-prose drift Step 7 cannot fix. Run doc-currency in CI as part of `--check`; the contract test in `tests/contract/doc-currency-baseline.test.cjs` is the regression gate.

**Inline allowlists** for legitimate edge cases (e.g. quoting a historical claim verbatim):

```markdown
<!-- doc-currency-disable-next-line -->
The original RFC asserted 12 action_kinds — we have grown beyond that.

<!-- doc-currency-disable -->
Block of prose where claim lint is silenced (e.g. a quoted email thread).
<!-- doc-currency-enable -->
```

Env kill-switch: `CORTEX_DOC_LINT_DISABLED=1` short-circuits the CLI to a no-op (exit 0). Use for emergency unblocks; the baseline test catches new drift introduced while disabled on the next CI run.

## Hand-curated vs auto-generated

**Why both matter:**

The two layers serve different lifecycles. Hand-curated content captures intent (why we built X, what trade-offs we accepted, what assumptions hold). Auto-generated content captures snapshot (what exists right now, how big, how green). Mix them in the same doc, separated by markers, and you get a single readable artifact that is 100% accurate on state without losing the wisdom.

**The split enables three properties:**

1. **No drift between docs and reality.** When a sprint adds a new action_kind, the count in the docs is wrong until somebody manually edits. With managed blocks, the next `cortex-doc-regen --apply` (or pre-commit hook) corrects it automatically. Operator never edits the count by hand.
2. **Wisdom survives refactors.** Hand-curated sections (rationale, principles, ADR references) are not touched by regen. A reorganization of `bin/steward/_lib/` can shuffle file paths inside auto blocks while the prose explaining *why* the steward exists stays put.
3. **Reviewable diffs.** When reviewing a PR, the operator sees `state-snapshot` updates as line-noise (expected churn) and concentrates on the hand-curated diff (the actual intent change). Without the split, every doc PR mixes both and the eye can't separate signal from churn.

**Test for whether content belongs inside markers:**

Ask "if I rerun cortex-doc-regen tomorrow without any code change, will this content be identical?"

- Yes → goes outside markers (hand-curated)
- No, it might change because code/tests/deps shifted → goes inside markers (auto)

If it would change but you DON'T want it auto-regenerated (e.g., a count you want to lag behind reality for narrative reasons), keep it outside markers AND add a `<!-- HAND-CURATED-COUNT: rationale -->` HTML comment explaining why. Future maintainers will see the deliberate choice.

## Composition with cortex-doc-regen

**Where to run:**

- **Manual:** `node bin/cortex-doc-regen.cjs --apply` after a sprint commit, before `git push`. Fast (<2s on cortex-x repo). Idempotent — second run is a no-op.
- **Pre-commit hook (opt-in):** install via `cortex-hooks-register --include-doc-regen`. Hook runs `--check` and refuses commit on drift; operator runs `--apply` then re-commits. Recommended for repos where doc accuracy is load-bearing for distribution (cortex-x itself, public-facing READMEs).
- **Weekly Steward cron:** `.github/workflows/steward-doc-regen.yml` runs `--apply` every Monday at 04:00 UTC, opens PR if drift detected. Closes the gap when operator forgets after a hot sprint.
- **CI verification:** `--check` runs in `.github/workflows/test.yml` and fails the PR if managed blocks are stale. Forces the operator to regen before merge.

**`/cortex-sprint` integration:**

The cortex-sprint skill (`shared/skills/cortex-sprint/SKILL.md`) integrates doc-regen as step 6 of its pipeline:

1. R1 web-research the topic
2. Decompose into sprint slices
3. Implement with one verification todo per implementation todo
4. R2 review pipeline (6 agents in parallel)
5. Update `CLAUDE.md` + `MEMORY.md` + sprint memory file
6. **Run `cortex-doc-regen --apply` to refresh all managed blocks**
7. Commit with conventional commit message + trailers

Step 6 is non-optional for sprints that ship new capabilities, action_kinds, or test infrastructure. For prose-only sprints (writing standards, docs, ADRs without code change), step 6 is a no-op (idempotent) so it stays in the pipeline.

**Failure mode:** if step 6 surfaces drift that wasn't caused by the current sprint (e.g., a previous sprint forgot to regen), include the drift fix in the same commit and note it in the commit body. Don't open a separate PR for orphan drift — folds in cleanly.

## Authoring patterns for new docs

**Template for a new doc that uses managed blocks:**

```markdown
# <Title>

> <One-sentence purpose statement - hand-curated, never auto>

## Overview

<Hand-curated context, rationale, when to use this doc>

## Current state

<!-- BEGIN cortex-x state-snapshot (v1) - managed by cortex-doc-regen -->
<!-- Do not edit between markers - regenerate via: node bin/cortex-doc-regen.cjs --apply -->
| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| Tests | 2955 |
| Action kinds | 18 |
| LOC (bin/) | 12,400 |
<!-- END cortex-x state-snapshot -->

## How to use

<Hand-curated guidance, examples, anti-patterns>

## Composition

<Hand-curated cross-links to related docs>
```

**Where to put state blocks:**

- usually near the top, in a "Current state" or "Snapshot" section, so readers see the live numbers before reading the prose
- only one block per ID per file (regen warns on duplicates)
- group related auto facts inside ONE block rather than scattering — easier to scan, fewer regex matches at regen time

**How to write hand-curated content that complements auto sections:**

- describe the *meaning* of the numbers (e.g., "2955 tests across 8 tier gates" — the tier-gate context is hand-curated, the count is auto)
- avoid restating numbers that appear in markers (would drift the moment regen runs)
- use phrases like "as of last regen" or "see snapshot above" when referencing auto values in prose
- explain *thresholds* and *targets* in hand-curated prose (e.g., "we target <300 LOC per CLI"); the snapshot table shows the current values

## Anti-patterns

- **Nested state blocks** — putting `<!-- BEGIN cortex-x foo -->` inside a `<!-- BEGIN cortex-x bar -->`. Regex match fails; regen skips both. Always flat, sibling blocks at column 0.
- **Prose with inline counts that contradicts state block** — writing "we currently have 5 action_kinds" in the section above a marker that renders "18 action_kinds". The prose rots; the marker stays accurate. Move the count into the marker or remove it from prose entirely.
- **Hand-edits inside state markers** — editing the rendered content between BEGIN/END thinking it'll stick. The next regen overwrites. If you need to keep a hand-curated value visible, move it outside the marker.
- **Block-id collisions across files** — using `state-snapshot` as the ID in two different files is fine (regen scopes per-file). But using `state-snapshot` and `state_snapshot` (snake_case) as separate IDs in the same file is forbidden — pick one form.
- **Stale version suffix** — leaving `(v1)` in the marker after the renderer schema bumped to v2. Regen detects the version mismatch and refuses to write (loud failure). Bump deliberately.
- **Missing END marker** — accidentally deleting the END line during a merge. Orphan BEGIN logs a warning but content downstream is preserved. Repair by re-adding the END line manually.
- **Auto-format reflow** — Prettier / VSCode markdown formatters can reflow HTML comments onto new lines or strip blank lines around markers. Add `<!-- prettier-ignore -->` if your editor enforces formatting, or configure the formatter to skip files matching `**/managed/*.md`.

## Failure modes and recovery

**Stale blocks (count says 5, reality is 18):**

Cause: forgot to run `--apply` after a sprint that added capabilities.

Recovery: `node bin/cortex-doc-regen.cjs --apply` then commit the resulting diff. If the drift is large, note it in commit body ("regen catches up after Sprint 2.X-2.Y forgot to run").

Prevention: install the pre-commit hook OR rely on weekly Steward cron.

**Conflict with editor auto-format:**

Cause: Prettier reflowed HTML comments or stripped blank lines around markers.

Recovery: revert the auto-format change, add `<!-- prettier-ignore -->` directly above BEGIN, re-save.

Prevention: configure project `.prettierignore` to exclude `docs/operator-pov/*.md` and other managed files; document in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

**Merge conflict inside state block:**

Cause: two PRs both ran `--apply` against different parent states; the block content diverged.

Recovery: accept either side (doesn't matter — `--apply` is deterministic on a given tree). Run `node bin/cortex-doc-regen.cjs --apply` post-merge to converge. Commit the result.

Prevention: rebase frequently; treat auto-block conflicts as no-op merges (always regen-able).

**Orphan BEGIN logged but commit allowed:**

Cause: deleted END line accidentally during a manual edit.

Recovery: re-add the END line manually with the matching block-id, then `--apply`.

Prevention: keep `--check` in CI; it warns on orphan BEGIN. Don't ignore the warning.

**Regen tool itself is broken (CLI crashes):**

Cause: extractor function threw on an unexpected repo shape (e.g., missing `package.json`, malformed git log).

Recovery: each extractor is fail-open by design — returns a sentinel value, never crashes the run. If a hard crash occurs, file an issue with the repo state and pass `--strict=false` to skip strict mode while debugging.

Prevention: extractors wrapped in `try/catch` per the `bin/cortex-doc-regen.cjs` design contract; CI exercises the fail-open path against fixture repos.

## Cross-links

- **`standards/documentation.md` § State block convention** — the SSOT for the marker contract lives here (Sprint 2.45). `standards/state-blocks.md` extraction deferred to 2.45.1+ if a second consumer emerges
- **`standards/documentation.md` § Hand-prose currency convention** — the SSOT for the prose-side currency contract (Sprint 2.46.2) — patterns A/B/C, forbidden F1/F2/F3, frontmatter fields, default cadence table, lint integration
- **`standards/sprint-pipeline.md`** — Step 7 of the canonical sprint pipeline runs `cortex-doc-regen --apply`; doc-currency verifies the surrounding hand-prose did not drift
- **`bin/cortex-doc-currency.cjs`** — Sprint 2.46.2 lint enforcing the hand-prose currency contract; pairs with `cortex-doc-regen` over a JSON snapshot interface

- **`standards/workflows.md`** — Steward cron workflow specifications including `steward-doc-regen.yml` cadence
- **`bin/cortex-doc-regen.cjs`** — the CLI implementation; header SSOT carries invocation details, exit codes, env vars
- **`shared/skills/cortex-sprint/SKILL.md`** — sprint pipeline that wires doc-regen in as step 6
- **`templates/CLAUDE.md.hbs`** — project-level CLAUDE.md template; new projects opt into managed blocks via the `with_managed_blocks` profile flag
- **`docs/operator-pov/atlas-*.md`** + **`docs/operator-pov/capability-tree-*.md`** — first operator-facing docs to adopt managed blocks (Sprint 2.45)

## Legacy guidance (project-level docs)

The original doc-philosophy content (README front-door rules, CLAUDE.md structure, PROGRESS.md sprint-state format, ADR template, JSDoc rules, comment hygiene) still applies to **scaffolded project repos** — those use plain markdown without managed blocks by default. cortex-x repo docs (this repo) layer managed blocks on top. Project repos can opt in per-file via `cortex-doc-regen --init <file>` (Sprint 2.46+).

Key rules from the legacy standard that remain in force everywhere:

- update docs in the same PR as code; don't defer
- docs in version control, not Notion/Confluence where they die
- docs close to code (`lib/ai/README.md` > centralized wiki)
- diagrams over prose for complex systems (Mermaid in markdown)
- examples over specs; show, don't tell
- delete stale docs; wrong info is worse than missing info

Anti-patterns from the legacy standard that remain forbidden:

- "TODO: document this" sitting for a year
- wiki pages nobody reads or updates
- comments explaining obvious code
- docs that contradict current behavior
- "see the code" as documentation
- massive docs nobody reads (shorter is better)
- documentation in language no one on team speaks
