# cortex-x — capability registry

> **AUTO-GENERATED** by [`bin/cortex-capabilities.cjs`](../bin/cortex-capabilities.cjs). Re-run `npm run capabilities` to refresh. Last generated: 2026-05-25T19:22:02.608Z

> Single source of truth for "what cortex-x can do today." Sprint 2.15 ships this as operator-facing answer to *"I do not even know what we have anymore"* and as future Steward system-prompt injection substrate.

## TL;DR — counts

| Category | Count |
|---|---|
| Steward action_kinds | 20 |
| Steward primitives (`bin/steward/_lib/`) | 51 |
| Universal hooks (`shared/hooks/`) | 7 |
| Standards (rule tiers 0-3) | 31 |
| Profiles (`profiles/`) | 11 |
| Prompts (`prompts/`) | 20 |
| Review-pipeline agents (`agents/`) | 10 |
| GitHub workflows | 23 |
| Tests total | 2861 (unit 2684 · contract 106 · integration 71 · smoke 0) |
| Runtime LoC (`bin/`) | 32,317 |
| Test LoC (`tests/`) | 37,851 |

> _Test count is computed via regex over `test()`/`it()` invocations across `tests/{unit,contract,integration,smoke}/`. The authoritative count for CI/release gating is whatever `npm test` reports (Node test runner) — currently slightly higher (~2339 at HEAD) because `describe()` blocks and some `.skip`/`.todo` variants resolve differently. Both numbers track the same suite; the regex is the discovery-surface estimate, `npm test` is the gate._

## 1. Steward action_kinds (20)

What the Steward autonomous runtime is allowed to DO. Dispatched via cron, manual, or recommendation harvester.

| Action kind | Description |
|---|---|
| `dep_update_patch` | npm outdated → patch-only diffs → npm test gate → draft PR. Deterministic, no LLM call. |
| `doc_drift` | Scan exported symbols (function/class/const/type), check mention in README/CLAUDE.md/docs/, file gh issues for undocumented public API surface. Deterministic — no LLM call. |
| `evolve_daily` | Daily consolidation phase ("Dreaming"). Pure-deterministic scan of journal/ + insights/ + cortex/projects/ — schema-validates journal entries, flags stale-candidate files past freshness thresholds, emits advisory rollup to insights/proposals/<date>-evolve-daily.md. Industry slov… |
| `evolve_weekly` | Weekly consolidation phase ("Dreaming" Phase B). Mines repeated-mistake candidates from journal/*.jsonl across 14-day window, applies deterministic evidence gates (min_events=3, min_projects=2, min_days_span=7), then LLM-validates each surviving candidate via cortex-thinker-styl… |
| `flaky_test_repair` | Marker-based quarantine: scan source for `// HERMES-FLAKY: <reason>` markers above test/it/describe declarations, replace with .skip + remove marker + open gh issue. Deterministic, no LLM call. |
| `lint_fix_shipper` | Run ESLint --fix (auto-fix style + simple violations) + tsc --noEmit (type-check, file issues for non-fixable errors). Deterministic. Capability #8. |
| `mutation_score_drift` | Run incremental mutation tests on touched modules; write reports/mutation.json snapshot; compute drift vs prior baseline. v1: snapshot-only (no PR opening, no auto-test-generation). Deterministic — no LLM call. Sprint 2.3b will land the executor + detector once vitest migration … |
| `pattern_transfer` | Read allowlisted sibling projects (cortex/sibling-projects.json) read-only, distill cross-project patterns into the CURRENT project's lessons-learned.jsonl. v1: journal-only — never opens PRs, never edits sibling repos. LLM-driven. Capability #11. |
| `pr_review_responder` | Monitor open Steward-authored PRs for unresolved reviewer comments, file aggregation issue per PR. v1: deterministic surfacing only — auto-patch parked v0.9+. Capability #9. |
| `recommendation` | Standard cortex/recommendations.md item. LLM produces edits, gates on npm test, atomic commit, draft PR. |
| `recommendation_harvest` | Read closed PRs + CI failures + open issues, append candidate observations to recommendations.md. Read-only — no LLM, no edits to source code. |
| `recommendation_harvest_parallel` | Sprint 2.2 multi-agent variant of recommendation_harvest. Supervisor spawns N=2 workers in git worktrees, each proposes alternative recommendation sets; same-tier judge LLM picks best by rubric. Foundation v0 (Sprint 2.2) ships utilities only — spawner/worker/judge are Sprint 2.… |
| `release_notes_drafter` | After merge to main, read merged PRs since last release tag, draft release notes. Future capability for v1.0+ release-management automation. |
| `secret_history_sweep` | TruffleHog full-history scan with --only-verified. On verified hit: opens gh issue with severity LABEL. NO auto-PR. Read-only against working tree; only writes are journal entries + gh issue create. Fail-open if trufflehog binary missing. |
| `senior_tester_review` | 2-stage hybrid test-quality auditor: deterministic detector (~16 smells with regex; tsDetect 21 + Sandoval ESE 2025 13 + cortex-original 5 in registry) + optional LLM judge for strategic synthesis. Writes journal entry + opens ONE gh issue per run. Never edits source/test files … |
| `tech_debt_audit` | Run qlty metrics + qlty smells + knip; snapshot to cortex/debt-snapshot.json; compute drift vs prior snapshot. v1: snapshot-only (no PR opening). Deterministic — no LLM call. |
| `test_coverage_gap` | Cross-reference coverage report (statements < threshold) + recently-edited files, file gh issue per gap. v1: deterministic detection only — LLM-driven test generation parked v0.9+. Capability #6. |
| `todo_triage` | Scan TODO/FIXME/XXX/HACK markers older than N days, dedupe vs open issues, file gh issues with git-blame context. Deterministic — no LLM call. |
| `wiki_consolidate` | Karpathy-style human-readable wiki layer over lessons.jsonl. Phase A is pure-deterministic — reads lessons.jsonl, groups by action_kind, emits one Obsidian-compatible article per kind to $CORTEX_DATA_HOME/wiki/<slug>/capabilities/<action_kind>.md. Frontmatter follows agentskills… |
| `workflow_hardener` | Advisory analyzer for .github/workflows/*.yml — flags unpinned action SHAs, missing permissions:/concurrency:/timeout-minutes:. v1 opens ONE gh issue with proposed patches; v1.5 will add auto-fix behind explicit env flag. |

## 4. Standards (31)

Rule tiers — see [`standards/RULE-1.md`](../standards/RULE-1.md) for hierarchy (Rule 0 distribution / 1 invariants / 1.5 coding behavior / 2 critical / 3 process).

| Standard | Title | Snippet |
|---|---|---|
| [`RULE-1`](../standards/RULE-1.md) | RULE 1 — Inviolable Architectural Invariants | Every piece of knowledge has **exactly one authoritative source**. No duplication. No drift. |
| [`accessibility`](../standards/accessibility.md) | Accessibility — Usable by Everyone | 1. **Perceivable** — content is presented in ways users can perceive (text alternatives, captions, color contrast) |
| [`ai-patterns`](../standards/ai-patterns.md) | AI Patterns — Agentic Architecture Standards | **Agentic-ready by default, agentic-heavy by intent.** |
| [`ai-sdks`](../standards/ai-sdks.md) | AI SDKs — Selection Standard | \| SDK \| Vendor \| Lang \| Model lock-in \| Best at \| |
| [`auto-optimization`](../standards/auto-optimization.md) | Auto-Optimization — Wizard Philosophy | **Rule 1.5 extension.** Not inviolable (Rule 1), but a contract on how cortex-x behaves. Violations degrade UX; don't break projects. |
| [`auto-orchestration`](../standards/auto-orchestration.md) | Standard — Auto-Orchestration (3-fronta rule) | \| Front \| Parallelize? \| Default count \| Evidence \| |
| [`coding-behavior`](../standards/coding-behavior.md) | Coding Behavior — Meta-Rules for LLM Code Generation | 2026-04-17 retrospective: the cortex-x scaffold work itself committed two behavioral anti-patterns caught only after the 5-agent review pipeline ran. Mass find-replace of a maintainer's name (drive-by refactor) and over-engineered 200-line |
| [`coding-behavior-examples`](../standards/coding-behavior-examples.md) | Coding Behavior — Concrete Examples | **Task:** "Add user export." |
| [`correctness`](../standards/correctness.md) | Correctness — Verification Beyond Structure | **Rule 2 (Critical)** — alongside Security, Testing, Observability. Must-have for any project moving beyond prototype. Review-pipeline flag = blocker. |
| [`documentation`](../standards/documentation.md) | Documentation — Knowledge That Outlives Your Memory | **Document decisions, not code.** Code explains itself (with good naming). Comments explain why. |
| [`error-handling`](../standards/error-handling.md) | Error Handling — Fail Gracefully, Recover Automatically | 1. **Fail fast at boundaries, fail gracefully inside.** Validate at API entry, crash early. Within the app, catch and recover. |
| [`git-workflow`](../standards/git-workflow.md) | Git Workflow — Commit Like a Pro | ``` |
| [`modular`](../standards/modular.md) | Modular — Isolated Subsystems | Tightly coupled code is where bugs hide and velocity dies. When changing X requires touching A, B, C, you don't change X — you avoid it. Modularity buys you the ability to refactor, replace, and scale individual pieces without cascading rew |
| [`multi-agent-supervisor`](../standards/multi-agent-supervisor.md) | Multi-agent supervisor + agent-as-judge ensemble — when, why, how to gate | cortex-x Steward runs LLM-driven actions serially by default — one process, one prompt, one verified outcome. **Multi-agent parallelism is the wrong default** for shared-context coding tasks because (a) it amplifies errors when topology is |
| [`mutation-testing`](../standards/mutation-testing.md) | Mutation testing — fitness signal beyond "tests pass" | A passing test suite proves nothing about whether the tests would catch a regression. Mutation testing systematically modifies your code (one operator change at a time) and re-runs the tests. If the mutated code still passes all tests, the |
| [`observability`](../standards/observability.md) | Observability — See What's Happening in Production | 1. **Logs** — what happened |
| [`performance`](../standards/performance.md) | Performance — Fast by Default | - **Core Web Vitals targets (2026):** |
| [`scalable`](../standards/scalable.md) | Scalable — Patterns That Survive 10x Growth | You won't know in advance which project succeeds. The ones that take off punish you for shortcuts taken early. Scalable-by-default means growth is exciting, not a crisis. |
| [`security`](../standards/security.md) | Security — Layered Defense from Day One | 1. **No secrets in git.** `.env` in `.gitignore` from first commit. Pre-commit hook blocks accidental commits. |
| [`self-correction`](../standards/self-correction.md) | Self-Correction — What Actually Works in 2026 | **Rule 2 (Critical).** Alongside Correctness — this standard prevents adopting patterns that measurably degrade agent quality. |
| [`ship-ready`](../standards/ship-ready.md) | Ship-Ready — Governance Invariants for Distribution | Anything a stranger would never need to know about the maintainer must not live in templates, prompts, standards, profiles, hooks, or install scripts. Includes: |
| [`skill-validate`](../standards/skill-validate.md) | Skill validation — 3-tier model + ToxicSkills baseline | cortex does NOT reimplement broad spec-conformance lint. `agnix` (npm, 414 rules) already covers that surface well. `cortex-skill-validate` runs AFTER `agnix` and adds three cortex-opinionated layers — spec-driven failure mode, Claude-Code- |
| [`skills`](../standards/skills.md) | Skills — Portable, Progressive-Disclosure Agent Instructions | **Rule 3 (Process)** — should-have convention. Skills are optional for trivial projects but deliver large leverage when you have repeatable procedures. |
| [`ssot`](../standards/ssot.md) | SSOT — Single Source of Truth | Duplicated knowledge drifts. Labels in 3 files become 3 slightly different labels. Constants in 5 places become 5 different values after one hasty edit. Bug fixes get applied to 4 of 5 copies. Entropy wins. |
| [`steward-policy`](../standards/steward-policy.md) | Steward Policy — Refusal List, Denylist, MUST patterns | Steward refuses the following at the tool-wrapper layer, **not via system prompt**. Promptword-only enforcement fails under prompt injection (Replit Agent prod-DB wipe, July 2025, is the canonical incident). All seven refusals are encoded i |
| [`story-sizing`](../standards/story-sizing.md) | Story Sizing — Rule 3 | Cortex-x scaffolds projects whose recommendation backlogs are consumed by autonomous agents (Steward, manual `/audit`, Ralph-style loops). Action items must be sized so an LLM can complete one in a single context window without losing track |
| [`test-types-catalog`](../standards/test-types-catalog.md) | Test Types — Exhaustive 2026 Catalog (SSOT) | **For the audit (Phase 5 selection oracle):** |
| [`testing`](../standards/testing.md) | Testing — Confidence Through Layered Coverage | Without tests: |
| [`verification-loop`](../standards/verification-loop.md) | Verification loop | Every implementation step must be paired with a verification step. Building proves the code compiles; verification proves the code does what was asked. |
| [`voice`](../standards/voice.md) | Voice — cortex-x identity & tone charter | The framework is invisible by default. **Claude is the actor, cortex is the environment.** This document is what cortex sounds like across all skills, so the operator hears one coherent agent — not eleven different bots wearing the cortex h |
| [`web-research`](../standards/web-research.md) | Web Research — Rule 3 standard | cortex-x assumes Claude's training cutoff is **older than the relevant external state** for most non-trivial tasks. Framework versions, library APIs, CVEs, regulatory thresholds, and design trends move faster than any model release. **Imple |

## Regeneration

```bash
npm run capabilities          # writes cortex/capabilities.md + .json
node bin/cortex-capabilities.cjs --json    # machine output
node bin/cortex-capabilities.cjs           # human markdown to stdout
```

A GitHub Actions workflow (`capabilities-refresh.yml`) re-generates this file on every push to `main`. Manual runs are also OK.
